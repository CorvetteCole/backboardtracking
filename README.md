# YOU ARE ON THE LEGACY BRANCH
This branch contains tracking methods that don't utilize the median method. This is stuff we tested before settling on the median code as superior. These may have unfixed bugs and aren't recommended to be used

# IrSensorTracking
Allows the finding of generalized location of where a basketball hit on the backboard of a basketball goal.

# VoltageMeasuring
Tool provided in folder to measure voltages from the analog pin a sensor is connected to. Tracking code is independant of this file. In other words, this isn't needed to run the main code.

# Development tools used
UnoArduSim V1.6.3: Used and allowed me to see exactly where my code was decided to run awry. Would highly reccommend. Its fairly intuitive as well.
ArduinoIDE: Pretty self explanatory. Just the official Arduino environment
Github: Used to manage this repository
