# IrSensorTracking
Allows the finding of generalized location of where a basketball hit on the backboard of a basketball goal.



#VoltageMeasuring
Tool provided in folder to measure voltages from the analog pin a sensor is connected to. Tracking code is independant of this file. In other words, this isn't needed to run the main code.


#Requirements
IrSensorTrackingMedian Requires STL for Arduino. To use this in the Arduino program click Sketch>Include Library>Manage Libraries.   
Then search for STL and install "ArduinoSTL". Next go to Sketch>Inlude Library>ArduinoSTL
