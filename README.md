# IrSensorTracking
Allows the finding of generalized location of where a basketball hit on the backboard of a basketball goal.



#VoltageMeasuring
Tool provided in folder to measure voltages from the analog pin a sensor is connected to. Tracking code is independant of this file. In other words, this isn't needed to run the main code.

#To-do
I need to seperate the code for each sensor in to seperate if statements in the median tracking file. If that greatly improves accuracy it will be implemented in the other types of tracking unless we deem median as the most effective (which I sort of think it is.)
