# IrSensorTracking
Allows the finding of generalized location of where a basketball hit on the backboard of a basketball goal.



#VoltageMeasuring
Tool provided in folder to measure voltages from the analog pin a sensor is connected to. Tracking code is independant of this file. In other words, this isn't needed to run the main code.


#Requirements
This now requires STL for arduino. http://andybrown.me.uk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/
